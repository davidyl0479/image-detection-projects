# CIFAR-10 CNN Classification

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that trains several Convolutional
Neural Networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch.

The notebook includes:
- data preprocessing  
- three CNN architectures  
- training and validation  
- test evaluation  
- visualisations (learning curves, confusion matrix, predictions)

The CIFAR-10 dataset is downloaded automatically when the notebook runs.
